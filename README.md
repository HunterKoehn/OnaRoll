OnaRoll is a simple virtual DnD dice roller application made with node.js and a small team of new engineers. We each did a different dice roll; mine being the d6, or normal sided die in this case. It was good experience in project management as I had an important role to debug code, answer any questions they may have had, and to completely rebuild the code if something happened in order to fix it.
